# Mohama

![](./assets/images/MOHAMA.png)

Formerly known as Mohama Tajalof – this local, Cyprus-based artist is the founder of the ‘Subaerial’ micro-ceremonies and the co-founder of the ‘C'est démon!’ and ‘Programmed For Love’ events series, that mainly take place on the island. Mohama always creates with the intention of serving deep and from within, without any chains or restrictions on either her material or her unique identity.
