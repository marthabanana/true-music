# Socrates

![](./assets/images/SOCRATES.png)

As the resident DJ and booker for the iconic Klubd in Nicosia, Socrates is as tuned-in and connected as they get on the music scene. This notorious spin master is passionate about vinyl and has a deep-seated interest in the real roots of the music he includes in his unique and uplifting sets, which predominantly lean towards the techno, house, trance, electro, breaks and trip-hop persuasions.
