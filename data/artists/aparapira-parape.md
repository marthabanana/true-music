# Aparapira Parape

![](./assets/images/APARAPIRA.png)

This DJ duo was born off the back of a lifelong friendship between George Papa and Joseph Herodotou, who bonded over musical connections and mutual weirdness. After organising a string of successful warehouse parties in the back alleys of Limassol, these dynamic selectors, became well known for their electric, weird sounding party-starting sets, spinning everything from wonky acid to disco glory.
