# Vassilis

![](./assets/images/VASSILIS.png)

Vassilis Palamas first played for an audience on a pirate radio station in Athens in 1987. But, it wasnâ€™t until he moved to Cyprus in 2007, that his career really took off. Today, he is influenced by world music, Latin, acid jazz, afrobeat and dance vibes, and still loves the joy of discovering new tunes and bringing satisfaction to listeners.
