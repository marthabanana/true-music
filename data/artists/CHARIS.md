# Charis

![](./assets/images/CHARIS.png)

Avid record collector Charis believes that if it’s a vinyl with a groove and a beautiful melody, it’s worth having in the collection. And true to his rich and varied library of music, this local DJ talent is influenced by the rich sounds of the world, from funk to soul and from reggae to (psy)-chill.
