# Patsas

![](./assets/images/PATSAS.png)

Patsas loves to make people dance and he’s got the musical know-how to keep the dancefloor grooving. As the founder of Brandy Sour, he has cemented his place at the heart of the contemporary music, event and DJ scene in Cyprus. And as a DJ, he takes his audiences on a journey through the more obscure, weird and wonderful end of the house and disco music spectrum.
