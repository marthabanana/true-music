# UK Garage

UK Garage (or UKG) first emerged in England in the early-1990s as an evolution of house music. Influenced by a combination of urban styles such as R&B, Jungle and Hip Hop, as well as Electronic Deep House and Drum & Bass, the genre has a signature syncopated 4/4 percussive rhythm and often features chopped-up, pitch-shifted vocals.
