# World

Used in the West to categorise different ethnic music styles from around the globe, World Music was first commercialised in the 1980s and is characterised by its inclusivity and versatility. The genre encompasses a variety of forms, including Indigenous, Folk and Neotraditional Music, and in recent years has expanded to incorporate subgenres such as Ethnic Fusion and Worldbeat.
