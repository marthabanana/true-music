# Soul

Characterised by catchy rhythms, handclaps, spontaneous body movements and the intense feeling – or soul – behind its vocals, Soul music first originated in the US in the 1950s and 60s. Predominantly popular within the African American communities who gave birth to the genre, Soul is heavily influenced by elements of gospel music, R&B and jazz.
