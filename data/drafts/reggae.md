# Reggae

The most prominent of a range of interconnected Jamaican music genres, Reggae originates from the Ska and Rocksteady movements of the 1960s, with influences from Caribbean Mento and Calypso music, as well as Jazz and R&B. Popularised by acts such as Toots and the Maytals or Bob Marley, lyrics typically carry messages of Rastafarianism and political commentary.
